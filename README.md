# Covid-spread-as-gradient-flow

A small collection of python scripts that offer some functionalities for plotting graph-based geographical systems.
The analysis is simply made from computing the gradient of municipalties with direct access (road, ferry or bridge).


For now, the script is pretty specific to my use case, but includes some helpful functions for eg. finding neigboring geographical regions from GML files
Uses Networkx, Pandas, ElemenTree among others
